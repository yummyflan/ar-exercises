# Your code goes here ...

# Borrowing and modifying the code from Exercise one, create 3 more stores:
# Surrey (annual_revenue of 224000, carries women's apparel only)
# Whistler (annual_revenue of 1900000 carries men's apparel only)
# Yaletown (annual_revenue of 430000 carries men's and women's apparel)
# Using the where class method from Active Record, fetch (a collection of) only those stores that carry men's apparel. Assign the results to a variable @mens_stores.
# Loop through each of these stores and output their name and annual revenue on each line.
# Do another fetch but this time load stores that carry women's apparel and are generating less than $1M in annual revenue.
